This blockset enables an easy access to MuJoCo Physics Engine and exposes the GUI, control inputs, sensors and RGB/Depth Cameras from the engine. 

## Installation Instructions

### MathWorks&reg; Products (https://www.mathworks.com)

- MATLAB&reg; (required)
- Simulink&reg; (required)
- Computer Vision Toolbox&trade; (optional)
- Robotics System Toolbox&trade; (optional)
- Control System Toolbox&trade; (optional)
- Simulink&reg; Coder&trade; (optional)

MATLAB R2022b or newer is recommended. Install MATLAB with the above products and then proceed to set up MuJoCo blocks.

## Build Instructions (mandatory)

Steps for building/rebuilding the C-MEX S-Function code. These instructions are only required if you are cloning the repository instead of downloading the release.

### Windows:

- Install one of the following C++ Compiler
  - Microsoft&reg; Visual Studio&reg; 2022 or higher (recommended)
  - (or) [MinGW (GCC 12.2.0 or higher)](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/mingw)
- Clone this repository or download the source zip  (preferably not in Downloads folder)
    
    `$ git clone git@github.com:mathworks-robotics/mujoco-simulink-blockset.git`
- Launch MATLAB and open the repository folder
    - `>> install`
- Open tools/ 
    - Open setupBuild.m. In case you are using MinGW compiler, edit the file and set selectedCompilerWin to "MINGW".
    - `>> setupBuild`
    - `>> mex -setup c++`
    - `>> build`

### Ubuntu

- Install the tools required for compiling the S-Function

    `$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential git libglfw3 libglfw3-dev `
- Clone this repository or download the source zip  (preferably not in Downloads folder)

    `$ git clone git@github.com:mathworks-robotics/mujoco-simulink-blockset.git`
- Launch MATLAB and open the repository folder. Run the install.m script.
    - `>> install`
- The default pathdef.m is likely not saveable in Linux. Save pathdef.m to new location as given in this [MATLAB answer](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/1653435-how-to-use-savepath-for-adding-path-to-pathdef-m-in-linux).
    `savepath ~/Documents/MATLAB/pathdef.m`
- Open tools/ and run the following commands in MATLAB command Windows
    - `>> setupBuild`
    - `>> mex -setup c++`
    - `>> build`

## Usage
`>>mj_gettingStarted`
    
Open the example model and run it in normal simulation mode.

If the installation is successful, you should see a pendulum model running in a separate window and camera streams displayed by Video Viewer blocks (Computer Vision Toolbox).

*A dedicated graphics card is recommended for the best performance. Disable Video Viewer blocks if the model runs slow*

*(Linux users) - In case MATLAB crashes, it may be due to a glibc bug. Please follow this [bug report](https://www.mathworks.com/support/bugreports/2632298) for a workaround!*

MuJoCo Plant block steps MuJoCo engine, renders visualization window & camera, sets actuator data, and outputs sensor readings

It takes an XML (MJCF) as the main block parameter. It auto-detects the inputs, sensors, and cameras from XML to configure the block ports and sample time.

Inputs can either be a Simulink Bus or a vector.

Sensors are output as a Simulink Bus.

RGB and Depth buffers from cameras are output as vectors. These can be decoded to Simulink image/matrix using the RGB and Depth Parser blocks.

## Tips and Tricks
- ***MuJoCo version update*** - Open install.m and change MJ_VER to desired MuJoCo physics engine version. 
- ***Code generation*** - The MuJoCo Plant block supports code generation (Simulink Coder) and monitor and tune for host target. Refer to mj_monitorTune.slx for more info.
- ***Performance improvement*** - In case you want to reduce the mask initialization overhead, you can directly use the underlying S-Function. Select the MuJoCo Plant block and Ctrl+U to look under the subsystem mask. Make sure to call the initialization functions (whenever the MJCF XML model changes).

## Limitations:

Linux Compatibility:

This blockset is only tested in Ubuntu 22.04 and Ubuntu 20.04. Other Ubuntu versions and distros are not supported.

### Software OpenGL:

This blockset does not work with software OpenGL. You can check whether MATLAB is using hardware GL with >>opengl info command.

In case you face graphics related issues, please try updating GLFW following the instructions given below!

## Bugs/Workarounds

### Rebuild GLFW From Source 

In case MATLAB crashes while running getting started model and you see the following lines in stack trace,

`#10 0x00007fdaf8619f40 in glfwCreateWindow () at /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglfw.so.3`

`#11 0x00007fdaf8675c4d in MujocoGUI::initInThread(offscreenSize*, bool)`,

Updating glfw could fix the issue.

Building glfw from source ([glfw main - commit id](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/tree/46cebb5081820418f2a20f3e90b07f9b1bd44b42)) and installing fixed this issue for me,
- sudo apt remove libglfw3 libglfw3-dev # Remove existing glfw
- mkdir ~/glfwupdated
- cd ~/gflwupdated
- git clone git@github.com:glfw/glfw.git
- sudo apt install cmake-qt-gui
- cmake-gui
- Set the source directory to the root of cloned repo
- mkdir build in the cloned repo
- Set the build directory
- In Cmake Gui settings - Select "BUILD_SHARED_LIBS" as well
- Configure and then generate
- Open a terminal in the build directory and run $make in terminal
- Once build goes through without any error, run $sudo make install in terminal
- sudo ldconfig (to refresh linker cache)
- Follow the build instructions for mujoco-simulink-blockset

The sample codes and API documentation provided for [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html) and [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/documentation) were used as reference material during development.

MuJoCo and GLFW libraries are dynamically linked against the S-Function and are required for running this blockset.
